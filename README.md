   ```
   - Get Weather - Get's the weather for city, state, country
   - Get Stock Quote - Get's the current stock price
   - Get Stock Technical Indicators - Get's the technical indicators for a stock and calculates them over a 6 month history
   - Get Stock News - Get's financial news for a stock symbol
   - Get Stock Financials - Get's the financial results (10K/10Q) for a stock symbol
   - Get Option Chains - Get's option chains (Calls & Puts) that are not in the money for a stock symbol
   - Python Code Execution - The ability to run  python code with the ability to do charting
   ```
